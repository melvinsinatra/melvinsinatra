## Hi there 👋

I'm Melvin, a full-stack developer based in Indonesia.
I'm experienced in working in an Agile / Scrum environment.

I build web and mobile apps primarily using Flutter, .NET, MSSQL, and Microsoft Azure resources. 
But I also know a touch of Next.js and Java

For UI frameworks, I like to work with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and a little of Material UI.
I'm very familiar with using Figma as a UI/UX collaboration tool, and Visual Paradigm for system design diagrams.

Always open to new opportunities!
